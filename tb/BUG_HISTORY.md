# BUG_HISTORY.md - emulator_mutrig DV bug ledger

Class legend:
- `R` = RTL / DUT bug
- `H` = harness / testcase / reporting bug

Severity legend:
- `soft error` = the bad packet/data flushes through the stream and does not leave the later datapath stuck
- `hard stuck error` = the bug poisons later packet handling and typically needs a functional reset / fresh restart to recover
- `non-datapath-refactor` = observability, reporting, harness, or naming/accounting consistency work with no direct packet-contract effect

Encounterability legend:
- practical severity is `severity x encounterability`, so the index must say how likely a reader is to hit the bug in normal use rather than only when it first appeared in one simulation log
- nominal datapath operation = legal traffic, about `50%` link load, iid per-lane behavior, and no forced error injection or artificially pathological stalls
- nominal control-path operation = routine bring-up / CSR program / readback / clear-counter sequences
- `common (...)` = readily hit in nominal operation
- `occasional (...)` = hit in nominal operation without heroic setup, but not in every short run
- `rare (...)` = legal in nominal operation, but usually needs long runtime or unlucky alignment
- `corner-only (...)` = requires a legal but non-nominal stress or corner profile
- `directed-only (...)` = requires targeted error injection, formal/probe flow, reporting-only flow, or another non-operational stimulus
- detailed `min / p50 / max` first-hit sim-time studies may still appear inside individual bug sections when they are useful

Fix status detail contract for active entries and future updates:
- `state` = fixed / open / partial plus the current verification gate
- `mechanism` = how the implemented repair changes the RTL or harness behavior
- `before_fix_outcome` and `after_fix_outcome` = concise evidence showing what changed
- `potential_hazard` = whether the fix looks permanent or is still provisional / profile-limited
- `Claude Opus 4.7 xhigh review decision` = explicit review state; use `pending / not run` until that review has actually happened

Historical formal note:
- No emulator_mutrig 26.2.x central-trigger DV bugs are indexed yet.
- The current supported formal direction is `qverify` / `znformal`, and the current supported simulator runtime is `QuestaOne 2026` at `/data1/questaone_sim/questasim`.
